# TWITTERLAB

This is a website that shows us 10 random users when we load the page, obtaining the results from https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10 . We can also add as many users as we want to friend. To know if it was added correctly we have added a property to change colour when you click on the user.

It also has two buttons:

- Save data

It is in charge of saving the data that the browser shows us at the moment. 

- Retrieve data

When the page is reloaded and the randomly displayed users are refreshed, if we click on the button we can retrieve the saved data.
